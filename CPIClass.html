    <img src="files/internship/photos/HeaderImage.jpg" alt="Brent At Desk" class="img-fluid mb-4 px-5">
    <h4 class="p-4 text-light">During my summer internship at Parsec Automation, I delved into the intricacies of the company's proprietary software, TrakSYS, while also exploring ASP.NET and Azure's capabilities. Under Mr. Rokos' guidance, I developed a webcam web app, interfaced with Azure's text recognition API, and even integrated chat GPT AI to generate SQL queries from human-text inquiries. Alongside technical accomplishments, I learned the significance of clear communication, especially evident when presenting project outcomes. Challenges like a phishing scam attempt and intricate data management issues highlighted the importance of decision-making and adaptability. The experience, filled with hands-on projects and valuable lessons, culminated in the successful demonstration of two proofs of concept and professional growth.</h4>

    <!-- Takeaways -->

    <h1 class="mb-2 text-light text-center">Three Key Takeaways</h1>
    <h4 class="p-4 text-light">1. The Power of Effective Communication: Through the process of presenting projects and collaborating with colleagues, I recognized the paramount importance of clear communication. Whether it was detailing technical specifications or advocating for a particular approach, the ability to articulate thoughts concisely was crucial. In my future roles, I aim to harness this skill not just in presentations but also in team collaborations, ensuring that projects are executed seamlessly and efficiently.
        <br><br>
        2. The Necessity of Adaptability: Encountering challenges, from technical setbacks like API connectivity issues to unexpected events like phishing scam attempts, underscored the need to be adaptable. Problem-solving in real-time and being able to pivot when needed was a recurring theme. As I progress in my career, I'll embrace an adaptive mindset, ready to tackle unforeseen challenges and turn them into learning experiences.
        <br><br>
        3. The Value of Hands-On Experience: While academic knowledge provided a foundation, the real-world application at Parsec Automation was invaluable. From developing a webcam web app to interfacing with advanced tools like Azure, the hands-on experience solidified my technical prowess. Moving forward, I'll seek out roles and opportunities that allow for practical application, knowing that such experiences are where true learning and growth occur.</h4>
